To run the Hotel Reservation System locally, ensure you have Java and MySQL installed on your system. Additionally, don't forget to add the JDBC connector to your project's dependencies. You can download the JDBC connector from MySQL's official website or use a build management tool like Maven or Gradle to include it automatically.

Once you have Java, MySQL, and the JDBC connector installed, clone the repository and follow the instructions in the project documentation to set up and run the system.
